# Valentine's Day Proposal Game 💕

A fun and interactive Valentine's Day proposal game where the "No" button runs away when you try to click it, making it impossible to say no!

## Features

- 💝 Beautiful romantic design with soft pink gradient backgrounds
- ✨ Interactive "No" button that dodges clicks and hovers
- 🎉 Confetti celebration when "Yes" is clicked
- 💫 Smooth animations with Framer Motion
- 📱 Fully responsive (works on mobile and desktop)
- ❤️ Floating hearts and sparkles for extra romance

## How It Works

1. The game displays the question "Will you be my Valentine?"
2. Two buttons appear: "Yes!" and "No"
3. When your girlfriend tries to hover over or click the "No" button, it moves to a random position
4. The "No" button text changes as attempts increase ("No way!", "Still no!", "Nope! 😊")
5. After 2+ attempts, encouraging messages appear
6. When "Yes!" is clicked, confetti fires and a beautiful success screen appears with a romantic message
